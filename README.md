# **NewsQuiz.js** 

## Spreadsheet to quiz!

**NewsQuiz.js** turns data from a Google Spreadsheet into a nice quiz, with lots of flexible options and a fluid layout. Uses Tabletop, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Google Spreadsheets. It's easy! 

The quiz looks like this:

[Basic Demo](http://motherjones.github.com/newsquiz/index-basic.html)

[Advanced Demo](http://motherjones.github.com/newsquiz/index-advanced.html)

### Like how easy?

    <div id="quiz_container"></div>

	<script>
		jQuery(function($) {
	  		$('#quiz_container').quiz(YOUR_SPREADSHEET_KEY); //The hard part: writing the actual quiz.
		});
	</script>
	
The hard part: writing the actual quiz.

# Getting Started: Make a Really Basic Quiz

### 1) Set up a Google Spreadsheet

Start a new Google Spreadsheet with the following column headers:

    question title	question text	right	right text	wrong	wrong text
    
(Don't sweat if you want to include extra goodies like images, videos, or additional titlesâ€”we'll get to that [later](https://github.com/motherjones/newsquiz#advanced-quiz)).

Write in all of your questions and answers. Want to include links? Stick anchor tags right in the cells.
  
In Google Docs, go up to the `File` menu and pick `Publish to the web`. Fiddle with whatever you want, then click `Start publishing`. A URL will appear, something like `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Arenb9rAosmbdG5GWHFXbWJlN1hTR2ZmN3lZMVZkOHc&output=html`

Copy that! In theory you're interested in the part between `key=` and `&` but you can use the whole thing if you want.

### 2) Set up your index.html page

Try the following, substituting your URL for `public_spreadsheet_url`

		<html>
		<head>
			<script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
			<script src="js/tabletop.js"></script>
			<script src="js/newsquiz.min.js"></script>      
			<link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen">
			<link href="css/bootstrap-responsive.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen">
			<link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen">
		</head>
		<body>
			<div id="quiz_container"></div>
				<script type="text/javascript">
					var quiz = jQuery('#quiz_container').quiz('public_spreadsheet_url');
				</script>
		</body>
		</html>

Load your index.html page in a browser, and check it out! **Pretty rad!** 

# Advanced Quiz
## Let's get fancy.

Want to mix pictures and video into your questions and answers? Want to add an extra title to some of your answers, but not all? We've included lots of flexible features.

See a demo of an advanced quiz with extra bells and whistles [here](http://motherjones.github.com/newsquiz/index-advanced.html). The spreadsheet driving this advanced demo is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuHOPshyxQGGdFM5ZWR6ajdzQ1Y5dFFZand1eS1MYmc#gid=0).

### Reference

Add **question**, **answer**, **right**, or **wrong** before any of these options in your column headers to apply to the right portion of your quiz item. See the [demo spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuHOPshyxQGGdFM5ZWR6ajdzQ1Y5dFFZand1eS1MYmc#gid=0) to see these options in action. You don't have to include all of these values for each item; see the section on Defaulting below.

`top image` puts an image above the title.

`top video embed` puts a video embed above the title, but below the top image, if you have one

`title` is the headline of each item.

`middle image` puts an image below the title.

`middle video embed` puts a video embed above the text, but below the middle image, if you have one

`text` is a blurb.

`bottom image` put an image below the text.

`bottom video embed` puts a video embed below the text

`background image` puts an image behind the text.

## Multiple wrong (or right) answers

If you want to have more than two possible answers, you can define multiple wrong or right answers in your spreadsheet.  Fill them out as before, but add a number, 0-9 after **right** or **wrong**. So for instance you'd have **wrong 7** or **right 1 top video embed**

## On Defaulting

Since it is a huge hassle to have to fill in multiple cells with the same information, we fail over to more generic cells if a specific value is not filled in.

**right 0-9** defaults to **right**, and **wrong 0-9** defaults to **wrong** value. Both **right** and **wrong** will default to **answer**, and **answer** will default to **question**. 

While this makes writing the quiz significantly less tedious, this does mean that you should bear the following in mind: 

**Do Not Mix Different Types of Image Values for a Single Question.**

If you do you will find yourself in the ugly position of having multiple images all over your answer. Yuck.

**How to Turn Off Defaulting**

There are two ways to do it.

1) To turn off defaulting for the entire quiz: In your project, add an options object as the second argument in your call to create the quiz. In the options argument, have the key `defaulting_behavior_on` set to `false`.

```
var quiz = jQuery('#quiz_container').quiz('public_spreadsheet_url', {defaulting_behavior_on : false});

```

2) To turn off defaulting for a single cell in your spreadsheet (or JSON), or turn on defaulting for a single cell if you've turned off defaulting for the whole quiz, simply enter the value `!default`. In other words, `!default` operates like a switch that enables or disables defaulting for a single cell depending on the defaulting status of your entire quiz.

If you don't care for the term `!default`, you can change the flag like so:

```
var quiz = jQuery('#quiz_container').quiz('public_spreadsheet_url', {defaulting_flag : 'REPLACE !DEFAULT HERE'});

```


## Writing your quiz in JSON

Writing your quiz in JSON is supported, though discouraged if you don't know JSON. The quiz object is formed like this:
```
[
    {
        possible_answers: [
            {
                answer: 'Newt Gingrich',

                bottomimage: '',
                bottomvideoembed: '',
                correct: true,
                middleimage: '',
                middlevideoembed: '',
                subhed: 'Correct!',

            }
        ],
        question: {

            subhed: '',
            text: '"Men are basically little piglets...Males are biologically driven to go out and hunt giraffes."',

        }
    }
]
```
You can pass that in as an argument instead of a Google Spreadsheet key, if you prefer.

## Strange behavior

**Empty tables are trouble.** We can't get column names from them (c'mon, Google!), so don't be too confused when a table with 0 rows is coming back with an empty `.column_names` or your code starts throwing weird errors when processing the results.
